### [Energy and Latency-aware Computation Load Distribution of Hybrid Split and Federated Learning on IoT Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3629188.3629201)

*In Proceedings of the 10th International Conference on Networking, Systems and Security (NSysS ’23)*, 2023  

In this paper, we develop an adaptive clustering-based computation load distribution method for hybrid Split and Federated Learning on IoT devices, with heterogeneous resource capacities, participating in the model training.

### [An Insight into Dhaka City's Walkability](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jahirsadikmonon insights-into-dhaka-city-walkability)
Publicly available dataset on Kaggle, 2023

Crowdsourced research project of a team of ~70 to collect and analyze a crowdsourced dataset on the walkability of Dhaka City. The dataset, available on Kaggle, provides insights into factors influencing walking experiences in the city.


## Ongoing Research Projects

**LULC Analysis of Bangladesh using Deep Learning**
<br>
Land use land cover (LULC) is defined how the land is used by humans or what the surface is covered with. The goal of this project is to produce good quality LULC annotation data pixel by pixel for Dhaka city and surrounding area. With a sufficiently trained segmentation model, we can employ this model to perform LULC over the entire Bangladesh without any human effort.

**Adversarial Threats and Robust Federated Learning in Satellite Communication Systems**
<br>
This work investigates vulnerabilities of federated learning models in satellite communication data to adversarial and poisoning attacks, and proposes strategies for enhancing robustness.
